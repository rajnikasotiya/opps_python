MediAssist â€“ Symptom-Based Diagnosis Assistant
Personal Project | NLP, LLM Integration, Groq

Built a healthcare assistant that analyzes user-input symptoms to suggest potential diseases, relevant medications, and precautionary measures.
Implemented NLP-based text similarity to match user inputs with known symptom-disease mappings using recursive text chunking for enhanced accuracy.
Achieved optimal performance with recursive chunking strategies; triggered fallback to an LLM via Groq API when similarity scores fell below a defined threshold.
Leveraged modern LLM tools to ensure robustness in complex or ambiguous input scenarios.
